## Deep Learning Model for Automatic Classification and Prediction of Brain Tumor Using VGG19
Small description about the project like one below
This project explores using a pre-trained VGG19 deep learning model to automatically analyze brain scans. By applying transfer learning and image adjustments, the model aims to classify brain tumors with high accuracy, potentially aiding in faster diagnosis.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Brain tumor is a condition in which a mass of abnormal cells grow inside the brain. The brain tumor can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Human brain is housed tightly inside a rigid skull to protect it. In an instance of the brain tumor, it starts putting pressure inside the skull on already compact brain structure. Such pressure can harm the brain tissues, causing mild to severe pain, and disrupting normal neurological functionalities in a human body.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Transfer Learning: It leverages a pre-trained VGG19 model, reducing training time and effort by utilizing its existing feature extraction capabilities.
- Image Preprocessing: Techniques like normalization and data augmentation are used to improve the model's ability to learn from the brain scan data.
- Automatic Classification: The model aims to automatically distinguish between cancerous and healthy brain tissue.
- High Accuracy (Potential): The project strives for high accuracy in classifying brain tumors, potentially leading to faster diagnoses.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
Brain tumor extraction and its analysis are challenging tasks in Medical image processing because brain image is complicated. Segmentation plays a very important role in the medical image processing.  In that way MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has become a useful medical diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of brain & other medical images. This project describes the proposed strategy to detect & extraction of brain tumor from patient’s MRI scan images of the brain.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
